Absolute positioning elements are not positioned based on 
themselves, as we saw with Relative positioning. 

They are rather positioned based on the surrounding, or 
containing elements.

In Absolute Positioning, you are always working with two 
elements. There's always a parent element, that is the
containing element that comes in to play with absolute 
positioning.


Absolute positioning displaces elements from the document flow.

So, if box1 drops down from a stack of three boxes, leaving 
2 boxes under it. The remaining 2 boxes will move up to replace
the space box1 formerly occupied - almost as though it doesn't 
exist and is instantly forgotten.


For Z-Index, the element or object with the highest number gets
to be in Front Order. So an element with a z-index of 3 will 
overlap or superimpose an element with a z-index of 2. And 2, 1.
